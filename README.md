## Background

Since leaving university I decided to take some time for myself by doing part time work and then exploring the world, but having had my fun, I am now looking for a job with progression, where I can feel that my work is valued and where I can get a sense of satisfaction with what I am doing. I have completed an Engineering degree at the University of Bristol where I have proved that I am capable of applying my mathematical knowledge, and am keen to do so after my diverse albeit quite bizarre career path so far.

Startups have always interested me. In the past I have often had conversations with my friends about ideas for new businesses, and I am currently involved in the business side of developing a new app that helps Vegetarians find food around London. In doing this I have found an interest in how these applications actually function and the challenges developers face, so I am looking for a role that will allow me to use my problem solving and mathematical skills to create.

## Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/edthomas93/bank-tech-test) | During the third final week at Makers we were given tech tests to create an application using the best possible practices in a limited timeframe | 3 days | Ruby | RSpec |
| [vBook](https://github.com/Team-Visage/vBook) | A clone of facebook using Ruby on Rails, a software that was completely new to us. In the second week we had change a lot of our code as the client decided React should be integrated in the project. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (including some Bootstrap), JavaScript, Heroku, React | RSpec, Capybara, Travis |

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I believe that a productive team is one that can maintain the ability to work through the highs and the lows.

For my second group project (creating a Facebook clone), we decided that the purpose of the 2 weeks was to learn and to try to use new technologies. Morale fluctuated as we underestimated how difficult it would be to wrestle with these tech stacks. Running daily standups and retros, I ensured that our group kept our eyes on the objective we set when we started â€” our moods always better coming out of them than going in as we could reflect on how much we had after particularly slow days. I believe this helped us to keep focus of what we wanted out of the project whilst maintaining good group cohesion. At the end

#### Communication

Working as a client support agent, I was frequently on the phone to customers, as well as when I went to Cambodia I had to break down cultural and language barriers to convey my ideas.

- When working in Cambodia I would ensure everyone engaged in conversations so I could see everyone had a solid understanding of the tasks at hand.
- I ran team meetings where I showed enthusiasm to keep the team engaged, leading to active discussions and maintaining focus in the heat.
- I actively pursued learning Khmer to improve relationships within the team although it was not required is I could appreciate the importance of making an effort with my counterparts, not relying on them to speak my language.
- I dealt with customer queries and assisted them in managing their finances at Hargreaves Lansdown, ensuring the customer had fully understood the risk with their investments.

## Education

#### Makers (July 2018 - September 2018)

- Makers has taught me many values, primarily how to test-drive my code.
- I am always aiming to widen my toolset by using unfamiliar languages or frameworks.
- I am a huge advocate of pair programming is ensures I craft well-written, readable code.
- I have no fear of tackling new technologies due to the speed of progression at Makers.

- Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS
- Web Frameworks: Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, node.js
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Firebase
- Testing Suites: RSpec, Capybara, Selenium-Webdriver, Jasmine, Cypress
