# Background

Since leaving university I decided to take some time for myself by doing part time work and then exploring the world, but having had my fun, I am now looking for a job with progression, where I can feel that my work is valued and where I can get a sense of satisfaction with what I am doing. I have completed an Engineering degree at the University of Bristol where I have proved that I am capable of applying my mathematical knowledge, and am keen to do so after my diverse albeit quite bizarre career path so far.

Startups have always interested me. In the past I have often had conversations with my friends about ideas for new businesses, and I am currently involved in the business side of developing a new app that helps Vegetarians find food around London. In doing this I have found an interest in how these applications actually function and the challenges developers face, so I am looking for a role that will allow me to use my problem solving and mathematical skills to create.

## Skills

#### Communication

Working as a client support agent, I was frequently on the phone to customers, as well as when I went to Cambodia I had to break down cultural and language barriers to convey my ideas.

- When working in Cambodia I would ensure everyone engaged in conversations so I could see everyone had a solid understanding of the tasks at hand.
- I ran team meetings where I showed enthusiasm to keep the team engaged, leading to active discussions and maintaining focus in the heat.
- I actively pursued learning Khmer to improve relationships within the team although it was not required is I could appreciate the importance of making an effort with my counterparts, not relying on them to speak my language.
- I dealt with customer queries and assisted them in managing their finances at Hargreaves Lansdown, ensuring the customer had fully understood the risk with their investments.
